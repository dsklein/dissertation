%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.

\begin{abstract}
  Two related analyses of data from the CMS Experiment are presented. The
  first is performed using 19.5 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton
  collision data from CMS Run I. In this analysis, six different asymmetry
  variables are measured in events with top-antitop quark pairs
  decaying to final states with two leptons. Unfolding techniques are
  used to extrapolate these measurements to parton level. No deviations
  from the predictions of the Standard Model are found, implying the
  absence of any influence from physics beyond the Standard Model. The
  second analysis is performed using 35.9 inverse femtobarns of
  proton-proton collision data collected during CMS Run II. In
  this analysis, a search is performed for evidence of stop squark pair
  production and decay to single-lepton final states. Several
  backgrounds, including dileptonic top-pair production, are estimated
  using control regions in the data. No excess above the Standard
  Model backgrounds is found, and exclusion limits are placed on three
  models of stop squark pair production.
